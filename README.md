# Escape the cyberspace

This a university project completed during the 2021 winter semester at the University of Applied Sciences Bielefeld for the Module "Computer Games (Visualization)".

The goal of the game is to escape the "cyberspace", which consists of three partly procedurally generated Levels.

The game was used to evaluate the effect of two different minimap types on the player.

## How to start the game

Download one of the included zip-archives in `evaluation/evaluation_builds'. The only difference between the two builds is, which minimaptype is used in the first level.

Unzip the archive and start the included `cyberspace.exe`. Only supports Windows.
